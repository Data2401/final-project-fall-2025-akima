## About the Data

The dataset used in this project comes from **Our World in Data**, an open-access research platform that compiles global historical information about energy, climate, and development. The file includes country-level observations of nuclear electricity production over time.

Key variables include:

- **country** — Name of the country or region
- **code** — Standard three-letter country code
- **year** — Year of measurement
- **nuclear_TWh** — Electricity produced from nuclear power (terawatt-hours)

The data spans multiple countries and years, allowing us to observe long-term nuclear energy trends globally. It allows comparisons across countries and time. This dataset is useful for exploring how nuclear power has changed, which nations produce the most, and how external events or policy changes may have influenced energy production.

## Introduction

Nuclear energy is an important source of low-carbon electricity, playing a role in helping countries meet rising energy needs while reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. However, nuclear energy adoption has not been the worldwide 1st approach to energy. Some countries have expanded nuclear energy production, while others have reduced output or phased out facilities, especially after major events such as its use in weaponry and power plant accidents.

This project examines historical nuclear electricity production across countries to identify long-term trends, compare major producers, and understand how global patterns may reflect policy, safety, and environmental considerations. This analysis aims to provide insight into nuclear energy’s place in today’s energy landscape and its potential role in the future.

## Questions and Graphs 
1) Which countries have had the highest nuclear energy production over time, and how have their outputs changed?
  planned graph: TBD
2) How has global nuclear electricity generation changed over time?
  planned graph: Line chart of global nuclear_TWh over year
3) How does nuclear energy usage differ by country or region?
  planned graph: Boxplot or grounded bar chart
4) Did nuclear generation trends shift after major historical events (e.g., Chernobyl, Fukushima)?
  planned graph: Before/after comparison timeline plot

```{r...}
##potential graph for 1st question
nuclear %>%
  filter(country %in% c("United States", "France", "China", "Russia")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = nuclear_TWh, color = country)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Nuclear Energy Generation Over Time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Nuclear Energy Generation (TWh)",
    color = "Country"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r question2, echo=FALSE}
##graph for 2nd question
# Summarize global nuclear power generation over time
global_nuclear <- nuclear %>%
  filter(!is.na(nuclear_TWh)) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(global_gen = sum(nuclear_TWh, na.rm = TRUE))

# Plot
global_nuclear %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = global_gen)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.1, color = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = "Global Nuclear Energy Generation Over Time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Nuclear Energy Generation (TWh)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
